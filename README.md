# Project Community - API

## Project Description
Project Community is a social media platform designed for users to share safety observation reports. The application is made up of a Django API and a React app.

### API
GitHub Repository - [project-community-api](https://github.com/AEMacBeath/project-community-api)<br>
Heroku App - [project-community-api](https://project-community-api.herokuapp.com/)

### React App

Heroku App - [project-community-ci](https://project-community-ci.herokuapp.com)


## Development
This API was developed as a series of small tasks recorded as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AEMacBeath/project-community-api/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Acreated-asc).

## User Stories
The user stories for this API were written in conjunction with the React application using [@AEMacBeath's Project Community](https://github.com/users/AEMacBeath/projects/11/views/1) GitHub Project.

The GitHub project is grouped by Milestones broken down into User Stories and Tasks.
